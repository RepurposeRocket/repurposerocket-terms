1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing repurposerocket.io (the “Site”) or using any Repurpose Rocket service (collectively, the “Service”), you agree to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any additional guidelines we post. If you disagree with any part, do not use the Service.

2. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your locale) to use the Service and, if under 18, have parental permission.

Refunds: Because editing time is pre-allocated, payments are non-refundable; however, we may grant credits at our sole discretion.

5. User Content Licence
You grant Repurpose Rocket a non-exclusive, worldwide licence to edit, reproduce and display the content you upload solely to perform the Service. You warrant that you own (or have cleared) all rights in the uploaded content.

7. Acceptable Use
You agree not to upload unlawful, infringing, obscene or hateful material, interfere with our systems, or reverse-engineer any part of the Service. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate this clause without refund.

8. Confidentiality
Both parties agree to keep non-public information obtained through the Service confidential for five (5) years after disclosure, except as required by law.

9. DMCA / Copyright Complaints
If you believe your copyrighted work has been used on the Site without authorisation, send a DMCA notice to hello@repurposerocket.io.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Repurpose Rocket and its officers from any claim arising out of (i) your content, (ii) your breach of these Terms, or (iii) your violation of any law or third-party right.

13. Termination
Either party may terminate at any time for convenience; however, Sections 5–12 survive termination. If you terminate mid-billing-cycle, your plan remains active until the end of that cycle.

14. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms; material changes will be posted with a new “Last updated” date at least 14 days before taking effect. Continued use constitutes acceptance.

15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. Any dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Austin, Texas, under AAA Commercial Rules. Either party may seek injunctive relief in state or federal court to protect intellectual property.
