Repurpose Rocket – Terms and Conditions of Use
Last updated: [June 13, 2025]

1. Agreement to Terms
By accessing repurposerocket.io (the “Site”) and any services we provide (collectively, the “Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part, please do not use the Service.

2. Who We Are
Repurpose Rocket is a trading name of Sam Francisco Productions LLC (“Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), registered in the State of Texas, USA.
Contact: hello@repurposerocket.io

3. Eligibility
The Service is intended for users 13 years of age or older. By using the Service, you represent that you are at least 13 and, if under 18, have parental permission.

4. Subscriptions & Billing
Plans are sold on a month-to-month basis via Stripe.

Auto-renew: Each plan renews every 30 days until cancelled.

Cancellation: You may cancel any time from the Stripe customer portal; service remains active until the end of your current billing cycle.

Refunds: Because production time is allocated immediately, payments are generally non-refundable. However, we may grant refunds or credits case-by-case at our sole discretion.

5. Deliverables & Revisions
We edit short-form video clips from content you provide.

Standard plans include the number of clips and revisions stated on our pricing page.

Source files remain available for 30 days after delivery; please download promptly.

6. Intellectual-Property Rights
Except for your own uploaded footage, all editing assets, templates, and proprietary methods remain our property.

Upon full payment, you receive a world-wide, royalty-free license to distribute the finished clips for any lawful purpose.

You grant us a limited license to display finished clips in our portfolio and marketing unless you email opt-out.

7. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:

Upload unlawful, infringing, or abusive material;

Resell, sublicense, or exploit any part of the Service without written consent;

Interfere with servers or networks;

Use automated scripts to collect data from the Site.

8. Payments, Taxes & Currency
Prices are listed in U.S. dollars. You are responsible for any applicable taxes or VAT in your jurisdiction.

9. Disclaimers
The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We make no warranties that deliverables will meet every specific expectation or generate particular results.

10. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability for any claim will not exceed (a) the amount you paid for the Service during the 12 months before the claim or (b) USD 500—whichever is less. We are not liable for indirect or consequential damages.

11. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any claim arising out of content you supply, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any law or third-party right.

12. Dispute Resolution
Before filing a claim, both parties agree to attempt informal negotiation for 30 days. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Texas, USA, under the AAA Commercial Rules. Either party may seek injunctive relief in state or federal court in Texas to protect intellectual property.

13. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance.

14. General
Governing Law: Texas and applicable U.S. federal law.

Severability: If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.

Entire Agreement: These Terms and the Privacy Policy form the entire agreement between you and us.
